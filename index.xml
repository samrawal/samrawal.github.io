      <description>I have been studying North Indian (Hindustani) classical vocal music for the past 17 years, for which I completed my Visharad in 2014. I also play the Tabla, a North Indian rhythm instrument. A short blog post on lessons from Tabla in medicine. Over the past decade, I&amp;#39;ve given around 30 Indian classical and light vocal and instrumental public performances. Below are some recent performances over the past year at UIUC:</description>

Some (current) personal favorites: Emacs:
emacs-secondmate, a &amp;#34;mini-imitation&amp;#34; of GitHub Copilot for Emacs via HuggingFace Transformers gpt-emacs-macro, running &amp;#34;semantic macros&amp;#34; in Emacs via GPT-3 (and a blog post on Semantic Macros in Emacs) Clinical AI:

      <description>I have been researching in the Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) space for the past 7 years. The overarching theme of my work is semantic parsing of clinical data (like Electronic Medical Records) to extract information that can be used to make actionable decisions for healthcare delivery and contribute to downstream research work. At Arizona State (2014-20), I worked under Dr. Chitta Baral in the Cognition and Intelligence Lab throughout my BS and MS, where I collaborated with organizations like the Mayo Clinic At the University of Illinois (2020-24) as a medical student, I am currently working under Dr.</description>
